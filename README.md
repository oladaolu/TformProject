Project Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps workflow for deploying a scalable and resilient application infrastructure using Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. The project aims to streamline the development and deployment process, enabling rapid and efficient delivery of applications.

Terraform
The terraform/ directory contains the necessary Terraform configurations to provision and manage the infrastructure on AWS. It includes definitions for VPCs, EC2 instances, security groups, and load balancers. With Terraform, infrastructure provisioning becomes automated, repeatable, and version-controlled.

Jenkins
The jenkins/ directory houses the Jenkins pipeline scripts responsible for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). These scripts facilitate the building, testing, and packaging of applications, ensuring high-quality deliverables. Jenkins enables seamless integration with various tools and platforms, empowering efficient and reliable CI/CD workflows.

Docker
The docker/ directory contains the Dockerfile for containerizing the application. By encapsulating the application and its dependencies in a Docker image, we achieve consistency and portability across different environments. Docker enables simplified deployment and management of applications in isolated containers.

Kubernetes
The kubernetes/ directory holds the Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster. It includes deployment configurations, services, ingress rules, and persistent volumes. Kubernetes provides orchestration capabilities, allowing for automatic scaling, fault tolerance, and seamless management of containerized applications.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Provision the infrastructure using Terraform: terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply
Configure Jenkins and set up the necessary pipelines based on the scripts in the jenkins/ directory.
Build the Docker image: docker build -t your-image-name:your-tag .
Deploy the application on Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
